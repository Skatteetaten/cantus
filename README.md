Cantus is a service for integration with docker registry.
The service is currently under development

The component is named after Cantus the Minstrel from the TV-show Fraggle Rock (http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Cantus_the_Minstrel).

To be able to run and make calls to Cantus you have to define variables in the file .spring-boot-devtools.properties located in the home folder.

The variables nedded are :
- cantus.docker-registry-url = localhost
- cantus.docker-registry-url-allowed = localhost, test


More information will come!
